description: "Self-evaluate a plan on a 100-point scale after it is created or updated. Make sure to use this skill immediately whenever you create a plan or update a plan, even if the user does not explicitly ask for a review. This skill ensures that the plan is clear, comprehensive, feasible, and consistent before execution."

# Plan Self-Review

Use this skill immediately after creating or updating a plan. Catching logical gaps, ambiguous steps, or missing dependencies early prevents cascading failures during execution. Self-reviewing your plan helps you approach the problem methodically and reduces the likelihood of needing major revisions later.

## Review Steps

1. **Score Plan (100pt)**: Evaluate the plan based on the following criteria:
   - **Clarity (25)**: Are the steps clear and easy to follow? Do they specify which files and tools will be used?
   - **Comprehensiveness (25)**: Does the plan cover all necessary aspects of the task? Are there any unaddressed edge cases?
   - **Feasibility (25)**: Are the steps achievable with the available tools and context? Do you have enough information to execute them?
   - **Consistency (25)**: Are there any logical contradictions or missing elements? Do the steps follow a logical sequence?
2. **List Deficiencies**: Create a prioritized task list (`- [ ]`) of any gaps, omissions, or ambiguities found in the plan.
3. **Improve**: Edit the plan to resolve the identified deficiencies. Update the plan using the appropriate tool.
4. **Final Check**: Perform a final check to confirm no logical contradictions or missing elements remain.

## Output Format

Present your review using the following structure:

### Self-Evaluation Score: [Score]/100
- **Clarity**: [Score]/25
- **Comprehensiveness**: [Score]/25
- **Feasibility**: [Score]/25
- **Consistency**: [Score]/25

### Deficiencies
- [ ] [Deficiency 1]
- [ ] [Deficiency 2]

### Improvements Made
- [Briefly describe the improvements made to the plan]

### Final Check
- [Confirm that the plan is now logically sound and complete]

## Examples

**Example 1: Reviewing a plan for adding a new API endpoint**

**Initial Plan:**
1. Create new endpoint.
2. Update tests.

**Self-Review Output:**
### Self-Evaluation Score: 40/100
- **Clarity**: 10/25 (Missing details on which file to edit and what the endpoint does)
- **Comprehensiveness**: 10/25 (Missing documentation update, error handling details)
- **Feasibility**: 10/25 (Too vague to execute without further clarification)
- **Consistency**: 10/25 (Logically sound but lacks concrete steps)

### Deficiencies
- [ ] Specify the exact file and route for the new endpoint
- [ ] Add error handling requirements
- [ ] Identify which test file needs to be updated and what test cases to add
- [ ] Include a step to update the API documentation

### Improvements Made
- Updated the plan to specify the target file (`src/api/users.js`) and route (`POST /users`).
- Added a sub-step for implementing input validation and error handling.
- Specified the test file (`tests/api/users.test.js`) and explicitly required testing the error cases.
- Added a step to update `docs/api.md`.

### Final Check
- The revised plan is now clear, comprehensive, and specifies exact files and actions. It is logically sound and ready for execution.
